# TeamSim
It's time to do some serious shit about forming fútbol-5 teams (or any other sport).


## Idea
Having a very professional, a.k.a EXPENSIVE, system for managing [amateur] fútbol players, in order to be able to create balanced teams for any match. Ergo, this requires players data to process. Ergo, requires some kind of processing (AI maybe? answer to me damn robot!) to create teams and show to users. Ergo, needs an auth system for loading data and being able to see results in some nice way. Ergo, it also needs some fancy cool graphics to render nice on any device. Ergo, it needs a responsive layout to render it from the app API. Ergo, it needs DRF to provide a nice API from its server database. Ergo, we need a DB and a server (Heroku maybe?). Ergo, ergo, ergo, ergo.

## Ergo
Some issues should be created to put some order on the development before people scream on fire all around.

## Ergo Idea Ergo
Anyone is free to create pull requests, as well I am free to decline every one and each of them, you sinners.
Ok, maybe one or two could be approved and merged.

## Final Ergo
Would be nice to have some webpack/sass/react in the frontend. Using bootstrap (4?) and customizing it.

## Final Ergo 2 Final Final
There're plenty of inspiration on tumblr and many other sites to how app could look like.

## Final Ergo 2 Final Final This One It Is Final I Swear
For backend I'm resting my nuts over django and its super-ergo-awesome admin. Same for auth. Ergo, oauth would be better?

See you around.

Ergo.

### Note
This is a remake of a previous old work that never saw the light called 'TeamSim and nazis on sharks'. Hopefully, this version will be better.
